# embeddings-usecase
This code covers two usecases with a naive simplistic approach: 1) **similarity search** with embeddings 2) **clustering and topic modelling** with embeddings


*Notes:*

Model used in example for embeddings (BERTLegal) â€” https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased

The embeddings are just stored locally, so moving closer to producion (and moving beyond experimentation) you probably want to use some feature rich, performant vector db (chroma, pinecone, etc)
